      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        We believe that there is nothing like sewing for expressing yourself.
        That is why we subscribe to the handcraft philosophy of sewing and
        handcrafting—keep sewing for memories of grandma, family, and friends or
        bring together magnificent colors, fonts, and handmade items for decor
        of inviting country home.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't mean we don't also like contemporary or modern home styles.
        Opposites in all things, after all. We believe that all homes should
        represent those who abide there and accentuate their personalities.
      </p>
