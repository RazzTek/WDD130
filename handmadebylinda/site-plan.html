        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            We believe that there is nothing like sewing for expressing yourself.
            That is why we subscribe to the handcraft philosophy of sewing and
            handcrafting—keep sewing for memories of grandma, family, and friends or
            bring together magnificent colors, fonts, and handmade items for decor
            of inviting country home.
        </p>
        <p>
            That doesn't mean we don't also like contemporary or modern home styles.
            Opposites in all things, after all. We believe that all homes should
            represent those who abide there and accentuate their personalities.
